    <h1>Quality of Life Around the World</h1>
  </header>
  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section class="intro">
    <p>
        This visualisation explores global quality of life indicators. It focuses on economic and social themes.
        This visualisation is designed to help students, researchers or merely curious viewers better understand how various factors interact across countries.
        The data draws from reputable open sources such as the World Bank and OECD.
    </p>
    <p>
        Various idioms are utilised to highlight geographic patterns and statistical corelations, making it easier for 
        users to compare regions and uncover insights. I encourage the reader to ask themselves "In what regard is living in Australia better than some other country that 
        is often idolised?". 
        Interactive features such as tooltips allow for these personalised insights.

      The map highlights worldwide differences in quality of life, providing the
      foundation for deeper analysis. Minimum wage numbers here have been adjusted for each country's cost of living.
    </p>
    <p class="chart-text">
      Did you know that Australia actually has the highest purchasing-power-adjusted minimum wage in the world?
      Another fun fact: Did you know that extremely developed nations like Singapore and Sweden actually have no legal minimum wage - it's entirely derived from the free market.
      Do you notice any trends between minimum wage and happiness levels of a country?

      <h2>Comparative Metrics</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond economics, social factors shape the quality of life for individuals in a country in a myriad of ways.
        Looking at factors like educational enrolment, healthcare spending and unemployment allow us to build a more holistic picture of wellbeing across different nations.
        These two charts complement each other: the parallel coordinate reveals broad multi-variable relationships across countries, while the radar chart
        illustrates detailed profiles for selected cases.
        </p>
        <br>
    <p>
        Compare your region of interest with the drop-down menu on the parallel coordinate chart!
        Look at individual country's statistics with the radar chart! What aspects could Australia improve in?
      </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            What patterns do you see when you compare developed countries with less-developed ones? Which developed country's statistics surprises you the most?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Higher-income countries often show lower infant mortality rates, higher life expectancy,better healthcare access and higher educational enrolment rates.
            Makes me wonder if I'm only in university because I am a mere naive beneficiary of being born in a developed country... 
            Some middle-income nations are closing the gap quickly, investing heavily in public health and education. 
            Meanwhile, countries with higher fertility rates frequently face challenges in providing universal education and healthcare coverage. Striking a balance is key for governments to achieve.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Fun fact: Bhutan, while small, places heavy emphasis on education and wellbeing, aligning with its philosophy of "Gross National Happiness".
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Note: The data here has been normalised on a scale of 0-1. Metrics such as education enrolment can be above 100% because of the way they are defined and calculated.

  <!-- Bar chart -->
  <section class="chart-row alt-layout">
    <div class="chart-text">
      <h2>Socioeconomic Breakdown</h2>
 <p>
    Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), gives us a fairer comparison of how much people can actually buy in 
    different countries. Instead of just looking at raw income, PPP accounts for cost of living and price levels — making it possible to compare living standards 
    across the globe.
  </p>
    <br>
  <p>
    Unsurprisingly, wealthy nations like Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Ireland often top the charts, with small populations and strong financial sectors giving 
    them a boost. On the flip side, emerging economies such as India and Nigeria rank lower, but their GDP per capita has been growing steadily over the last 
    decade.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fun fact: If the European microstate of Luxembourg were a person, they’d be one of the richest in the world — its PPP-adjusted GDP per capita is more than 
    5 times the global average. Meanwhile, Qatar has historically been a frontrunner thanks to oil and gas, though diversification is shifting its numbers. 
    Another surprise? Despite being one of the world’s largest economies, China’s per capita GDP still lags far behind developed nations, reminding us how 
    population size plays a huge role.
  </p>
    <p>
        Note that GDP per Capita is basically an averaged metric. This means it does not solely represent the median person - that if there are a handful of rich people this would 
        skew the value higher. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Author's note: I've lived in Singapore and confirm my family earns nowhere near that GDP per Capita nor is our purchasing power that high :'( numbers can be quite deceptive huh?
        I guess GDP per Capita alone is not a metric to show the quality of life, but rather the overall economic prosperity of a country.

        The bubble chart shows how government spending relates to immigration,
        suggesting that stronger welfare states attract more newcomers.

        The bump chart illustrates changes in immigration flows, providing a
        dynamic view of how migration patterns evolve.

      <h2>Tourism and Well-being</h2>
      <p>
        Tourism provides another lens on quality of life. Cultural richness,
        environment, and openness all shape both perceptions and lived experiences
        of well-being.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This dashboard demonstrates how quality of life is influenced by a complex
      mix of economic, social, and cultural factors. From global patterns on the
      map to the dynamics of migration and tourism, the evidence highlights the
      interconnected nature of well-being in today’s world.

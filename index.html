    <h1>Quality of Life Around the World</h1>
  </header>

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section class="intro">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This visualisation explores global quality of life indicators. It focuses on economic and social themes.
      It is designed to help students, researchers or curious viewers understand how various factors interact across countries.
      Data is drawn from reputable sources such as the World Bank and OECD.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various idioms are used to highlight geographic patterns and statistical correlations, making it easier 
      to compare regions and uncover insights. Interactive features such as tooltips allow for personalised exploration.
    </p>

  <!-- Map -->
  <section class="chart-section">
    <h2>Global Overview</h2>
    <div id="map" class="chart full-width"></div>
    <p class="chart-text">
      The map highlights worldwide differences in quality of life. Minimum wage numbers here have been adjusted for each country's cost of living.  
      Did you know Australia has the highest PPP-adjusted minimum wage in the world?  
      Fun fact: developed nations like Singapore and Sweden have no legal minimum wage at all.

      <h2>Comparative Metrics</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond economics, social factors shape quality of life: healthcare spending, education enrolment, unemployment, fertility rates and more.  
        The parallel coordinate chart shows broad multi-variable relationships, while the radar chart illustrates detailed profiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compare your region of interest with the dropdown menu on the parallel coordinate chart, or inspect single countries in the radar chart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Higher-income countries often show lower infant mortality, higher life expectancy, better healthcare access and higher education enrolment rates.  
        Some middle-income nations are closing the gap quickly. Bhutan, for example, prioritises education and wellbeing in its philosophy of "Gross National Happiness".
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: The data here has been normalised on a scale of 0–1. Some education metrics exceed 100% due to how they are defined.

  <!-- Bar chart -->
  <section class="chart-row alt-layout">
    <div class="chart-text">
      <h2>Socioeconomic Breakdown</h2>
      <p>
        GDP per capita, adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), compares living standards fairly by accounting for cost of living.  
        Wealthy nations like Luxembourg and Switzerland top the charts, while emerging economies such as India and Nigeria rank lower but are growing steadily.
      </p>
      <p>
        GDP per capita is an average: it doesn’t necessarily reflect the median citizen. A few wealthy individuals can skew the figure upward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Author’s note: Having lived in Singapore, I can confirm our family’s purchasing power feels far below the official GDP per capita figure!
        GDP per capita shows economic prosperity, but not necessarily quality of life for ordinary people.

  <!-- Bubble + Bump -->
  <section class="chart-column">

    <div class="chart-text">
      <h2>Government Expenditure & Immigration</h2>
      <p>
        Higher government reinvestment into society generally leads to happier people.  
        Nordic countries like Sweden and Norway show how strong welfare states translate into high life satisfaction.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="bump_chart" class="chart center-chart"></div>
    <div class="chart-text">
      <h2>Migration Trends Over Time</h2>
      <p>
        The bump chart illustrates changes in immigration flows to Australia.  
        Immigration reflects global disparities in opportunity and quality of life — people “vote with their feet” for better futures.

    <div class="chart-text">
      <h2>Tourism and Well-being</h2>
      <p>
        Tourism can boost GDP and employment but also creates trade-offs.  
        Countries like Japan and Spain show that rapid growth in tourism can strain infrastructure, raise costs and spark cultural debates.  
        The bubble chart shows tourism has not been effective in reducing unemployment in countries like Spain, Turkey and Greece.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This dashboard demonstrates how quality of life is influenced by a complex mix of economic, social, and cultural factors.  
      From global patterns on the map to migration and tourism dynamics, the evidence highlights the interconnected nature of wellbeing today.

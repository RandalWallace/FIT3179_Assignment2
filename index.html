    <h1>Quality of Life Around the World</h1>
  </header>
  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section class="intro">
    <p>
        This visualisation explores global quality of life indicators. It focuses on economic and social themes.
        This visualisation is designed to help students, researchers or merely curious viewers better understand how various factors interact across countries.
    </p>

    <p>
        The data draws from reputable open sources such as the World Bank and OECD.
    </p>

    <p>
        To make complex relationships obvious, various idioms are utilised to highlight geographic patterns and statistical corelations, making it easier for 
        users to compare regions and uncover insights. I encourage the reader to ask themselves "In what regard is living in Australia better than some other country that 
        is often idolised?". Maybe even compare it to your home country if applicable! 
        Interactive features such as filters and tooltips allow for these personalised explorations/insights. Have fun!
    </p>

  <!-- Map -->
  <section class="chart-section">
    <h2>Global Overview</h2>
    <div id="map" class="chart full-width"></div>
    <p class="chart-text">
      The map highlights worldwide differences in quality of life, providing the
      foundation for deeper analysis. Minimum wage numbers here have been adjusted for each country's cost of living.
      Did you know that Australia actually has the highest purchasing-power-adjusted minimum wage in the world?
      Another fun fact: Did you know that extremely developed nations like Singapore and Sweden actually have no legal minimum wage - it's entirely derived from the free market.
      Do you notice any trends between minimum wage and happiness levels of a country?

      <h2>Comparative Metrics</h2>
      <p>
        These two charts complement each other: the parallel coordinate reveals
        broad multi-variable relationships across countries, while the radar chart
        illustrates detailed profiles for selected cases.

      <h2>Tourism and Well-being</h2>
      <p>
        Tourism provides another lens on quality of life. Cultural richness,
        environment, and openness all shape both perceptions and lived experiences
        of well-being.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This dashboard demonstrates how quality of life is influenced by a complex
      mix of economic, social, and cultural factors. From global patterns on the
      map to the dynamics of migration and tourism, the evidence highlights the
      interconnected nature of well-being in todayâ€™s world.
